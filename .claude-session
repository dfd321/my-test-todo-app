Task: Building todo app following Claude v3.1 standards
Branch: main
Progress:
  ‚úì Basic Express server with CRUD API
  ‚úì Vanilla JS frontend with filters
  ‚úì JSON file persistence
  ‚úì Git repository initialized
  ‚úì Claude v3.1 configuration structure
  ‚è≥ Server currently running on port 3000
  ‚è≥ Need to add proper error handling
  ‚è≥ Need to add input validation
  ‚è≥ Need to add tests
  ‚è≥ Need to fix script.js template syntax issues

Next Steps:
  1. Fix JavaScript template string issues in public/script.js
  2. Add proper error handling throughout
  3. Add input validation on both client and server
  4. Add basic tests
  5. Add proper logging
  6. Review against v3.1 quality checklist

Key Decisions:
  - Using JSON file for simplicity (not database)
  - Express + vanilla JS (no framework complexity)
  - Following v3.1 modular structure
  - Prioritizing reliability over features

Server Status:
  - Running on http://localhost:3000
  - API endpoints: GET/POST/PUT/DELETE /api/todos
  - Frontend serves from /public

Issues Found:
  - Template string syntax errors in script.js
  - Missing input validation
  - Basic error handling only
