## 📋 Next Actions (Priority Order)

1. **Fix critical bug** (Issue #3) - App currently non-functional
2. **Push to GitHub** - Complete repository setup
3. **Add input validation** (Issue #1) - Security compliance
4. **Add tests** (Issue #2) - Quality compliance
5. **Enhanced error handling** - Production readiness
6. **Documentation** - Team collaboration

## 🔧 V3.1 Tools Integration
